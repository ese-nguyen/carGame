# Car Game
A car game written in C++ with SFML library. This is final project of the computer science course in my university. I worked with 2
teamates.

You can open the project with Visual Studio.

If you run VS 2017, copy the SFML folder to your driver D:.

If you run other versions of VS, please go to https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.0/ to have more infomation. You should copy it to 
drive D: and change the name of the folder to SFML.

Or you can learn how to configure the the properties of the SFML project in VS here:
